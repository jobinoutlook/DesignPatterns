The MemberwiseClone method creates a shallow copy by creating a new object, and then copying the nonstatic fields of the current object to the new object.
If a field is a value type, a bit-by-bit copy of the field is performed. 
If a field is a reference type, the reference is copied but the referred object is not; therefore, the original object and its clone refer to the same object.
